Hi ðŸ‘‹
Nice to meet you

This is my story. <br/>
I have always wanted to tell it.

|----| ------------- |
| 2022-ongoing | **Volunteer at [Inochi2d](https://github.com/inochi2d)** <br/> Helped with Rust and Project Management  on [Inox2d](https://github.com/inochi2d/inox2d/)|
| 2022-ongoing | **Started [bevy_rpg](https://github.com/project-flara/bevy-rpg), [Project Flara](https://github.com/project-flara/project-flara/)**<br/>`bevy_rpg` is a Rust library for using RPG-like dialogs in the Bevy game engine, while Project Flara is a prototype JRPG game that employs `bevy_rpg`. |
| 2022 | **Started [Waylovely Project](https://github.com/waylovely-project/) and [Flara Shop](https://github.com/waylovely-project/flara-shop)**<br />Waylovely is an initiative for desktop Linux application support in non-rooted Android devices, while Flara Shop is an app store client app for Flathub that uses the Flarapak library created for this project. <br/>These projects are currently onhold due to ongoing hiatus. | 
| 2021 | I started learning much more and more. I moved on from failed projects to another, each of them teached me a great lesson I could use in the future. |
| 2020 | This is where my story starts. The pandemic closes our schools and I fell in love with programming from Discord bots tutorials |
